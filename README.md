# PPML
AcademicProject / Extension of ”Predictive Business Process Monitoring with LSTM Neural Networks” (Tax et al., 2017)

# Description:
This project is an academic extension of the paper:
"Predictive Business Process Monitoring with LSTM Neural Networks" by Tax et al., 2017.
It modifies and extends the original approach by:

Shifting the focus from Next Event Prediction to Remaining Cycle Time Prediction.
Introducing k-fold cross-validation and new evaluation metrics for better model performance.


# Repository Contents:
source_code.py: Core Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
plot_outputs.py: Generates training/validation accuracy and loss graphs.
